summary: 'Iâ€™m an experienced Senior Web Developer from Berlin looking for a new challenge.
<br><br>
I have 6 years experience in developing multi-country enterprise e-commerce websites with the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. After 5 years of non-stop, full-time work in 2017 I felt a calling to experience more of our planet. I said farewell to my position and began to travel the world, starting in India. 
<br><br>
My travels across the world gave me an understanding of the fragile state that our planet is currently in, and I could no longer justify working in fashion e-commerce, knowing that it is environmentally unsustainable. So after a year in Melbourne I decided to return to Berlin to align my job with my values.
<br><br>
I am ready and eager to take the next step on my journey, and use my programming skills for something good; something that has a positive impact on the planet.'
